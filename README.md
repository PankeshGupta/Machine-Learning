# Some of My Machine-Learning Projects

## Gender Classifer 
Given Certain features of a specific individual. This model predicts whether the data is either a male or female. Typically classification model. This is verified on various models such as MLPClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, GaussianNB, Treeclassifier. This includes an accuracy score monitor that indicates the % of correctness in the predictions made.

## Linear Regression 
Includes two price predictors and behavior predictors, where the default sklearn boston house and another fiticious dataset is used. Additionally, it includes a predictive model for fiticious company where the intent is to understand and predict human behaviour on their platforms such as web and app which enables decision makers to dictate the company's marketing efforts.
